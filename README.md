# -CyberThreatDetection-ML-EDRTelemetry
This repository contains the code for the project "Enhancing Cyber Threat Detection using Machine Learning on EDR Telemetry." The project aims to improve threat detection accuracy and efficiency in EDR systems by leveraging machine learning models trained on client-specific telemetry data. Implementation follows the CRISP-DM methodology.
